# PseudoSeer Proxy

This is a proxy solution for the PseudoSeer application that allows users to access the Penn State University-hosted application while staying on your Netlify domain. This approach avoids showing the `pseudoseer.ist.psu.edu` URL in the address bar.

## How It Works

The solution uses a combination of:
1. **Netlify Functions**: A serverless function that proxies requests to the PSU server
2. **Iframe Integration**: Displays the proxied content in an iframe
3. **URL Rewriting**: Modifies relative URLs in the content to work with the proxy

## Features

- **Domain Masking**: Users stay on your Netlify domain
- **Full Functionality**: All PSU application features work through the proxy
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if the proxy fails
- **Loading States**: Professional loading indicators
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry on connection failures

## Project Structure

```
├── index.html              # Main page with iframe
├── netlify/
│   └── functions/
│       └── proxy.js        # Serverless proxy function
├── _redirects              # Netlify redirect rules
├── netlify.toml           # Netlify configuration
├── package.json           # Dependencies
└── README.md              # This file
```

## Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Netlify account
- Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)

### Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Push your code to a Git repository
   - Connect your repository to Netlify
   - Netlify will automatically detect the configuration and deploy

3. **Manual Deployment**:
   - Install Netlify CLI: `npm install -g netlify-cli`
   - Run: `netlify deploy --prod`

## Configuration Files

### `netlify/functions/proxy.js`
- Proxies requests to `https://pseudoseer.ist.psu.edu`
- Modifies HTML content to fix relative URLs
- Removes problematic security headers
- Handles errors gracefully

### `_redirects`
- Routes all requests through the proxy function
- Keeps the main page accessible

### `netlify.toml`
- Configures build settings and functions
- Sets security headers
- Defines function bundling

## How the Proxy Works

1. User visits your Netlify domain
2. The iframe loads content from `/.netlify/functions/proxy/`
3. The proxy function fetches content from `https://pseudoseer.ist.psu.edu`
4. URLs in the content are rewritten to work with the proxy
5. The modified content is served back to the iframe
6. User sees the PSU application but stays on your domain

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Function Timeout**: Netlify functions have a 10-second timeout limit
2. **CORS Issues**: The proxy handles CORS automatically
3. **URL Rewriting**: Relative URLs are automatically fixed

### Debugging

- Check Netlify function logs in the dashboard
- Use browser developer tools to inspect iframe loading
- Test the proxy function directly: `yourdomain.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/proxy/`

## Security Considerations

- The proxy respects the original server's security policies
- No sensitive data is stored or cached
- All requests are logged for monitoring
- HTTPS is enforced for all connections

## Performance

- Content is cached for 5 minutes to improve performance
- Static assets are served directly when possible
- The proxy adds minimal latency
